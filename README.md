2-Create a new page

Add Custom Html blocks for each part in "'minified.min.html"' or edit CSS and
edit other codes for an improved version. Important thing is that you need
to correct URL paths according to your own URL. You need to be sure codes did
not misadd if you minify your edited codes too. Then add your advertisements
between those blocks. Publish the page.
